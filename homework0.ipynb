    "_Rico recently was inspired by Uber and created his own ride-sharing company called Joyride. This company is like Uber, but only luxury cars are used to pickup and drop off people. Luckily, he has hired you, a CS 506 expert, to help him with his company._\n",

    "- `car_model` (`CarModel` enum)\n",
    "- `max_gas_tank` (float, in gallons, the maximum amount of gas the car can hold)\n",

    "- `mpg` (float, miles per gallon, how many miles the car can drive per gallon of gas)\n",
    "- `cost_per_refill` (float, in dollars, how much it costs to refill the gas tank, which is paid by Joyride)\n",
    "- `capacity` (int, number of people the car can hold)\n",
    "- `price_per_mile` (float, in dollars, how much Joyride charges passengers per mile the car has to drive. NOTE that this is independent from number of passengers in the car.)\n",
    "- `total_miles_driven` (float, in miles, how many miles the car has driven in total)\n",

    "- `license_plate` (string, the license plate of the car)\n",
    "\n",

The preferences are ranked here from 1 to 3, with 1 being the most preferred and 3 being the least preferred (Here, `capacity` has the highest preference and `price_per_mile` has the lowest preference). This also means your code should work for any group of preferences given.\n",

    "**Clarifying Questions you asked Rico:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"How do I sort if the user put in a number that does not match any car?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Let's give an example of this situation. If you have a customer give a preference like\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> {\n",
    ">     \"mpg\": 90\n",
    "> }\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> But no car has exactly 90 miles per gallon, you can compute it's distance from the closest car's mpg and sort based on that. For example, if the closest car has 80 mpg, then the distance is 10 since the customer wanted 90 (90-80 = 10). If the closest car has 100 mpg, then the distance is respectively 10. You can then sort based on the distance, where the smaller distance is the more preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"What would happen if a user put in a car that does not exist in the `CarGarage`?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If this is the case, then the output should be an empty list. This is because the user's preferences cannot be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"How do I sort the CarModel values? I can't just sort the enum values.\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In this situation, do the following: If the CarModel is the exact CarModel that is given in the preference, assign it a number like 1. For all the other CarModels that do not match the one in the preferences, assign them a bigger number like 2. Then, sort based on the number you assigned to each CarModel. This way, the CarModel that matches the preference will be sorted first.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"I'm not sure how to sort the cars based on multiple preferences in python, how do I do this?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can manipulate the `lambda` feature from Worksheet 0.\n",
    "> You are welcome to ask ChatGPT about it or use this link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-a-list-of-objects-by-multiple-attributes-in-python/.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"Do I consider tie-breakers?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Nope! Don't worry about tie-breakers. If two cars have the same distance from the customer's preference, then you can just put them in any order. Similarly, if two cars have the same exact values for each field, then you can put them in any order as well.\n",
    "\n",
    ">_\"Can you give a basic example?\"_\n",
    "> Sure, consider this preferences dictionary:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> {\n",
    ">     \"car_model\": (CarModel.LEMON_LAMBORGHINI, 2),\n",
    ">     \"capacity\": (4, 1),\n",
    "> }\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here, `capacity` is more important (priority 1) than `car_model`. To sort this, look at a given car list and see which ones are closest to capacity of 4. Then, if there is a tie, look at the `car_model`.\n",
